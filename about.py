Our program:-

 It is actually about finding,selling the books with user ease.."
 "A book is a dream that you hold in your hand. "
 "Whenever you read a good book, somewhere in the world a door opens to allow in more light."

Our Mission:-

We aims to facilitate an user friendly and easy interface,through which easy accessiblity of books,
along with easy processing of them can be done to the customers.
"Focus on the user and all else will follow."

Features:-

1.Information of all the books available in store.
2.information of all the customers.
3.information of all the purchases.
4.Order info with billing.

Our Objectives:-

1.Reduction of paper work
2.Automation of existing manual information systems.
3.Fast retrieval of all type of information.
4.Good efficiency and response time.
5.More consistent data handling.
6.A user-friendly system which do not require any special training or expertise of computer. 

General information:-

Testing phase of our program:-

testing is vital to the success of the system.System testing makes a logical
assumption that if all the parts of the systems are correct,the goal will be
successfully achieved.Inadequate testing leads to errors that may not appear
until months later.this creates two problems:

The time lag between the cause and the appearance of the problem
The effect of system errors on files and records within the system
A small system error can conceively explode into a much larger problem.
Effective testing early in the process translates directly into long term cost
savings from a reduced number of errors.
Another reason for system testing is its utility as a user oriented vehicle before
implementation.

The best program is worthless if it doesn't meet user needs.
Unfortunately user's demands are often compromised by efforts to
facilitate program or design efficiency in terms of processing time or memory
utilization. Often computer techinician and user have communication
barriers...The system tester(designer,programmer or user) who has
developed some computer mastery can bridge this barrier.


Program legacy:-

Current Status of project:-

The project i.e computerization of book store has been completed
successfully. various phases(Requirement Analysis,Data Design,Coding,
and testing) have been completed.
the project has been underlined and kept in vision for correct
functioning.
